# Goal
The purpose of this repo is to explain and illustrate the basics of Services Lifetimes in .net's dependency injection. 

# Prerequisites
If you do not understand the concept of dependency injection, please read up on that first (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

# How to Use the app
Part of understanding Service Lifetimes is knowing how they appear in code. For that reason, it is encouraged that you open this in Visual Studio and run it from there. You should run the app from Visual Studio so you can see both IIS and the console output. To do that: 

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the app in Visual Studio
3. Run the app from Visual Studio
4. Ensure you can See both IIS and the Console. 
5. Call the "/api/Step0_StartHere endpoint
6. Read the console output
7. Follow the instructions in red from the console output
8. Repeat steps 6 & 7 until you've completed all steps
